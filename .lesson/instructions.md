# Instructions  

**DESCRIPTION**

On your own, select an interesting movie poster that contains a reasonable amount of textual content (at least a few paragraphs, some headings, some quotes, or other text-based content). Decide how you might assign a variety of HTML elements to the content, then build out a web version of the page.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Pick an interesting movie poster (with enough image resolution to make out all the text).
2. Type out all of the textual copy from the poster into a code editor.
3. Mark up each part of the resulting document with a variety of HTML sectioning and phrasing elements.
4. Include a few useful hyperlinks to the official movie web site and/or some reviews.
5. Add some interesting images to the page to make the poster look more convincing.
6. Include some inline, embedded, or external CSS rules to visually control a variety of aspects of the page text (colour, font-family, font-size, alignment, line-height, line-height, etc.). Do your best to approximate the appearance of the original text of the movie poster you selected for the assignment - it does not need to look exactly the same.
7. Validate the resulting HTML document (proceed to [http://validator.w3.org](http://validator.w3.org/)).
8. Upload your HTML page and any images to your Web server and determine the URL to view the result.


**TAKE IT FURTHER**

Here are a few ideas to help you go beyond the basic requirements for this assignment â€“ feel free to attempt any other technical or creative challenges that you think are appropriate:

- Try to use an image search to find a PNG or JPG version of your selected poster without any text - download the image.
  1. Use the following CSS to apply the PNG or JPG as a background image to your HTML document:
  2. html {
     background-image: url("../images/poster-image-background-filename.jpg");
     background-size: cover;
}
- Use a Web font service like Google Fonts to emulate the type as it appears on the real movie poster.
- Add some interesting images using the \<figcaption\> element.
- Have fun!

**SUBMITTING YOUR WORK**

Upload an image of the selected movie poster (that you used for your inspiration) _and the URL to your HTML page_ (on a web server) to the this assignment.
